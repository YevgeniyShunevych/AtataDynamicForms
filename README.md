# Atata Dynamic Forms - WhosOn Chat Window Tester

This chat window tester is designed to be used with WhosOn's echo bot to allow for a chat window to be validated.

## Goals

1. Fill in the chat window and validate that the chat window functions.
2. Take screenshots of the chat window so that it can be compared against previous iterations.
3. Make a manual process automated and be able to use this inside Azure Pipelines.
